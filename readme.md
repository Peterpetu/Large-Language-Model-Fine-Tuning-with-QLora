# QLora Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models

### Introduction
This project is exploration in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on the fine-tuning of a pre-trained language model using the Quantized Low Rank Adapter (QLoRA) technique. QLoRA represents a recent innovation in NLP, offering a efficient methodology to adapt and enhance large-scale language models while prioritizing computational and memory optimization. The project integrates QLoRA into an existing Finnish open-source language model, previously not optimized for instruction-based tasks. By employing low-rank matrix approximation and weight quantization, the project adapts the model for instruction finetuning, enhancing its task-specific performance capabilities. As an experimental prototype, this project serves as a scalable foundation, demonstrating the potential for evolving into a full-fledged finetuning project with larger parameter sizes. The primary objective is to showcase the effectiveness of QLoRA in strategically refining a language model for specific instructions, providing valuable insights into balancing model adaptability, computational efficiency, and performance integrity in the rapidly evolving field of large-scale NLP models.


### QLoRA Fine-Tuning Process
The QLoRA fine-tuning process in this project is a detailed sequence of steps, crafted to augment a pre-trained language model's capabilities with a focus on efficient computational resource management.

### Steps in the QLoRA Fine-Tuning Process:
1. **Model and Tokenizer Initialization**: This phase involves initializing a pre-trained model and its tokenizer from Hugging Face's model hub. This baseline model possesses an inherent understanding of language structures and patterns.

2. **Adaptation for QLoRA**: The model is configured for quantized training, a hallmark of QLoRA, which reduces the model's size and memory usage without significantly impacting learning capacity. Simultaneously, parameters not involved in fine-tuning are frozen to decrease computational load.

3. **Low Rank Adapter Integration**: This crucial phase involves fine-tuning parameters such as rank, alpha (lora_alpha), target modules, dropout rate, and bias for the adapter, aligning them with the specific NLP task. The adapter is then integrated into the model for targeted learning.

4. **Optimized Training and Evaluation**: The reduced model size facilitates efficient training. Performance metrics are closely monitored, and post-training, the model undergoes a thorough evaluation against predefined benchmarks to verify the fine-tuning's effectiveness.

### Dataset Preparation and Analysis
The `dataset_tokenization_analysis.py` script is integral to analyzing the dataset's tokenization process. This analysis ensures optimal dataset compatibility with the model's training process.

### Model Analysis and Testing
1. **Fine-Tuned Model Analysis**: The `finetuned_model_analysis.py` script compares the original and fine-tuned models. 
2. **Model Prompt Testing**: The `model_prompt_test.py` script tests the model's language generation capabilities with various prompts.
